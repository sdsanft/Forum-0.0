# Full Stack App
##### By Sam Sanft
My first attempt at creating a full stack web application. Still a work in progress.

A forum app that currently allows users to create and view threads and posts that are than saved to a database. The app uses node.js and express.js to manage the backend and react.js to handle the frontend presentation. All of the data is stored in a MongoDB Atlas cloud database.

### How To Run
1. Download and install node.js and MongoDB
2. ` git clone https://github.com/sdsanft/NodeTest-0.0.git `
3. ` npm install `
4. ` npm run start `
